description: Targeting your job listing helps us decide who we should show your job listings to.  We recently added a widget to the targeting page to help set effective targeting parameters.  This is a description of how it achieves that goal.

When you post a job on Careers, we advertise your job on Stack Overflow, the world’s largest developer community. There are lots of different kinds of developers out there.  Providing us with some descriptions of the kind of developer you are looking for helps us advertise directly to the right people for your company.

##The targeting screen

On the targeting screen you have a few options for how to describe the role you need filled.

###Developer types
Developer Types is the most general role: “Full Stack Developer” and “Mobile Developer” are examples. This is the most impactful feature you can select. Although two selections are allowed, you are almost always better off just choosing a **single option** here.  Only if your job requires developers to be _very_ proficient in multiple roles will two selections help. If your job sees a second role as a benefit or you are willing to train for it on the job, selecting just the more important one will help find more qualified candidates.

###Technology ecosystems
In this category you will find “stacks” or collections of technologies that roles might require. You might have heard someone say “I’m a Node developer”, or “I’m an Android developer”. They are describing the set of tools with which they are most proficient – and we can target that directly.

In addition to ecosystems, there are many complementary tools listed in here such as “SQL Server” or “Cloud”. While these are not the primary stack, they are helpful to know. It is encouraged to select any choices that apply here.

###Region
This allows you to specify the list of countries in which we should advertise your job.  We **only** show your job to developers in these locations. Developers browsing Stack Overflow from anywhere else will not be able to see your listing and we will not show ads for your job to them. Use this if you are _unwilling_ to hire developers who would require special permission to work in your country.

##Potential targets

As you modify these high level targeting features, you will see the _Potential Targets_ widget on the sidebar update.  This number is a rough estimate of the size of the market for developers you want to hire based on your targeting criteria.

In this expanded details view, you can see a breakdown of the market.  Total targets are the developers in the area around your _Targeted City_.  Close matches are the developers who match any of your targeted criteria, and strong matches are the developers who match **all** of your targeting criteria.

If he number of _Potential Targets_ drops too low (depending on location, there are just very few developers in some of the more remote areas of the world), then you are made aware of that up front with this tool.  You can alter your targeting criteria or consider offering flexible work options such as allowing remote workers to increase the size of your targeted market.

###How we know

Nearly every developer in the world uses Stack Overflow to find solutions to the problems they encounter in their daily lives. That’s important. [Stack Overflow sees what developers actually use](https://careers.stackoverflow.com/about-targeting), not what they say they use on resumes. There is no other companies in the world with direct access this quality of data.

Our advanced targeting technology makes use of this data to determine the tools and roles each developer is proficient at. As developers use Stack Overflow, we show them ads matched using your job’s targeting criteria. Targeting your jobs leads to more qualified candidates applying to your job.
