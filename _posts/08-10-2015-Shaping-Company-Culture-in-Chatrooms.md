Stack Overflow has ~250 employees. We live and work in 13 countries spanning 8 timezones; 60 people work [remotely](https://blog.stackexchange.com/2013/02/why-we-still-believe-in-working-remotely/) and everyone else works at our offices in New York City, London and Denver. Our commitment to remote work is one of the things our employees love most about working here, but it raises the issue: How can we sustain a cohesive culture? 

Well, to start, we have to actually know each other. 

To do this well, we have to lower more than the barriers of distance and time; we also have to be able to connect as individuals. There must be inclusion, which — to us — means trying to create a workplace in which individuals are valued and treated as equals. We’re doing a cool thing called DIP Chat to foster this sort of environment, and it’s time to share it with the world (or at the very least you, the faithful Stack Overflow blog readers).

## Some Background
At Stack Overflow, we have an employee-driven group called DIP (Diversity and Inclusion Panel) that spans all company departments. DIP recognized early on that the company, like the industry, is made up of people with wildly different experiences, particularly when it comes to diversity and discrimination. There are employees who deal with diversity-related bias daily, and others who are not only unaffected, but also largely unaware to what extent their peers are affected. 

To address this discrepancy we needed to find a way to advance intra-company communication and inclusion. Despite being a highly data-driven company, we were unconvinced that the available studies/statistics/data were going to move the needle. So, we took the opposite approach — we went decidedly personal. 

## DIP Chat
Once a month we host a one-hour online chat in which employees can candidly and respectfully engage in discussions around diversity. The chat is, most importantly, an inclusive space that welcomes anyone at the company who is interested to share, observe, ask and learn. It is the catalyst through which we can make a difference in the climate surrounding diversity at Stack Overflow.

DIP Chat is strictly internal, optional, and hosted in our employee-only company chatroom. The time is dedicated to 2-3 volunteers — who are arranged about a week ahead of time so they have time to prepare — sharing their personal experiences and feelings around diversity at Stack Overflow or in tech. We save the conversations as artifacts that employees can read after the fact if they miss the live chat or want to re-absorb the information. The result is a richly informative and emotional experience that we think strengthens our empathy and inclusiveness. The idea sounds a little crazy (especially to HR), but there are a few components that have been strategic to its success at Stack Overflow.

###Respect

There is a lot of respect amongst peers here. I firmly believe that this idea can only work if people trust each other enough to make themselves vulnerable — there can be no hostility whatsoever. We also follow our [Be Nice Policy](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/240839/the-new-new-be-nice-policy-code-of-conduct-updated-with-your-feedback) that we practice in our communities, and keep everything 100% internal.

###Focus

Each chat has a topic, like English as a Second Language, LGBT, or Parenting/ Work-Life Balance, that we discuss within the scope of working at Stack Overflow or the workplace in general. We also select a moderator to make sure things don’t derail by slipping off-topic or becoming toxic (while we have never experienced the latter, I will concede that we have been guilty of the former).

### Vulnerability

The real secret sauce, though, is that our volunteers share their (very) personal experiences of observing and dealing with bias. By giving a firsthand account, they are bringing the issue close to home — it becomes impossible to not care. Participants are able to ask questions, offer support, share perspectives and know that everyone has good intentions, because the people who showed up want to make this world/ industry/ company a better place to be. 


## Is it working?
Feedback has been largely positive. Even people who thought it would never work have given it rave reviews. Employees from different parts of the company, in both department and location, are learning from each other and growing in a way that previously wasn’t available. I think it works so well because we like to know the people we work with every day, and connect with them on deeper, more human levels. 

DIP Chat isn't a silver bullet. It hasn't changed the culture at Stack Overflow so that it's 100% cohesive or inclusive. It is, however, markedly improving our internal dialog and strengthening relationships. 

We know there’s always more to do, but we’re pleased with the progress we’re making.
