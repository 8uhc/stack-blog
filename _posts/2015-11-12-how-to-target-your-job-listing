description: Targeting your job listing helps us decide who we should show your job listings to.  We recently added a widget to the targeting page to help set effective targeting parameters.  This is a description of how it achieves that goal.

When you post a job on Careers, we advertise your job on Stack Overflow, the world's largest developer community.  There are lots of different kinds of developers however.  Providing us with some high level descriptions of the kind of developer you are looking for helps us show ads for your job to the developers who are most likely to be interesting in the type of work you need to hire for.

On the targeting screen you have a few options for how to describe the role you need filled.  The first is the _Developer Types_ which you can think of as the most general role.  Full Stack Developer or Mobile Developer are the kinds of things in this category.  This is the most impactful feature you can select.  Although two selections are allowed, you are almost always better off just choosing a single type here.  If your job requires developers to be very proficient in multiple roles, then selecting two will help.  If your job sees a second role as a benefit or you are willing to hire on the job, selecting just one will help find more qualified candidates.

The second feature is _Technology Ecosystems_.  In this category you will find "stacks" or collections of technologies that roles might require.  Developers often describe themselves as being proficient in a stack.  You might have heard someone say "I'm a node developer", or "I'm an Android developer".  They are telling you what set of tools they are proficient with and we can see target that directly.  In addition to stacks, there are many complementary tools listed in here such as "SQL Server" or "Cloud".  It is encouraged to select any choices that apply here.

The last thing on this page is _Targeted Region_.  This allows you to specify the list of countries we should show your job in.  We **only** show your job to developers in these locations.  Developers browsing the Stack Overflow from anywhere else will not be able to see your listing and we will not show ads for your job to them.  This is useful if you are unwilling to hire developers who would require special permission to work in your country.

As you modify these high level targeting features, you will see the _Potential Targets_ widget on the sidebar update.  This number is a rough estimate of the size of the market for developers you want to hire based on your targeting criteria.

In this expanded details view, you can see a breakdown of the market.  Total targets are the number of developers in the area around your _Targeted City_.  Close matches are the developers who match any of your targeted criteria, and strong matches are the developers who match **all** of your targeting criteria.

If he number of _Potential Targets_ drops too low (depending on location, there are just very few developers in some of the more remote areas of the world), then you can are aware of that up front with this tool.  You can alter your targeting criteria or consider offering flexible work arrangements such as allowing remote workers to increase the size of your targeted market.

###How we know what kinds of developers our users are

Nearly every developer in the world uses Stack Overflow regularly to find solutions to the problems they are encountering in their daily lives.  That's important.  They are looking at questions for the technologies they are using.  [Stack Overflow sees what developers actually know](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/about-targeting), not what they say they are using on resumes and profiles.  There are no other companies in the world with direct access this quality of data on developers.

Our advanced targeting technology makes use of this data to determine the tools and roles each developer is proficient at.  As developers view pages on Stack Overflow, we show them job ads based on how much of your job's targeting criteria match their proficiencies.  Targeting your jobs leads to more qualified candidates seeing and applying to your job.
