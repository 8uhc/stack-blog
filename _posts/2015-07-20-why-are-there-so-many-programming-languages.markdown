I was asked this question twice in the past week, by colleagues who work with our clients. It sounds like a dumb question, but it’s anything but.

The short answer is that in fact we don’t *need* so many languages, but we *want* them. Let’s unpack that a bit.

You can create a web site using Ruby, Java, Python, C#, Go or JavaScript. You can use C or C++ or Haskell or Rust. Or COBOL or Pascal or Perl.

Underlying this fact is that all of these languages are *Turing complete*. That’s a highfalutin computer science term which states, essentially, that any language is capable of creating any program.

In a sense, at their most foundational level, these languages are all the same. But on the surface, they vary a lot. This is where utility comes in.

### Utility

Any developer will tell you that a JavaScript program looks really different than a Python program. And any developer will tell you that creating a web site in Ruby is easier than creating one in C.

Programming languages are tools, and we choose different tools for different jobs. A tractor trailer and a Tesla are both vehicles – they have wheels and engines and will get you from point A to point B – but we choose differently based on the task at hand.

We make choices based on trade-offs. Some languages are flexible but slow, others are strict but fast.

The 18-wheeler is great for hauling refrigerators but a bad choice for dropping the kids at soccer practice. A bicycle is a good way to deliver groceries in Manhattan, but not in Wyoming.

Similarly, Ruby is a good way to build a web site but you wouldn’t use it to do air traffic control. You *could*, but you wouldn’t.

### Taste

Beyond utility, we developers have tastes. We have preferences.

A programming language is a tool for humans to express ideas to computers. Read that again: humans, express.

Because we have so many choices of good programming languages, we can choose based on personal preferences. Some developers like Ruby’s flexibility, while others prefer Java’s strictness. Some languages look like math, where others feel like prose.

### People

Beyond utility, and beyond taste, businesses run on people. Sometimes, you will choose a programming languages based on what you, or the people around you, know.

Stack Overflow chose C# mostly because that’s what our founders knew. In turn, it’s what the founders’ friends and colleagues knew. Which made recruiting easier, and which allowed Stack to get to market more quickly.

(Luckily, C# also happens to have excellent technical characteristics.)

### Variety is strength

In summary, we have a lot of languages because it pays off. This variety of tools makes interesting programs – and interesting companies, and interesting careers – possible.
