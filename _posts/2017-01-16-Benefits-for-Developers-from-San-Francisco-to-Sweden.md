I just started my new job here at Stack Overflow, and like most of us, one thing I think about when considering a career move is what kind of benefits a company offers. Firms looking to hire developers can create a [company page](http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/companies) here at Stack Overflow. This means that we here on the Data Team can explore what types of benefits companies offer developers and how those benefits change across companies of different sizes or in different locations. In this post, we'll use text mining and data visualization to investigate the benefits companies offer to the developers they hire.

## Most Common Benefits

Check out [Stack Overflow's own company page](http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/companies/stack-overflow) (so meta!) to see an example of what a company page can look like; each company can list benefits as text describing what they provide. To start with, probably to no one's surprise, most companies with pages here on Stack Overflow offer developers health insurance, paid vacation, and a retirement plan. Other very common benefits include flexible schedules and stock options. When we analyzed the benefits posted by companies on Stack Overflow, these were the most common, and certainly I know they are high priorities for me!

Here we see that companies use different combinations of words to describe very similar benefits; there are really only a few separate concepts represented in this chart of most common benefits. Also notice that companies like to communicate that they offer competitive salaries, even though I am not quite sure that counts as a benefit per se.
